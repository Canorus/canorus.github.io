#Daryl

Daryl is a performant and responsive [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme. It aims to be simply designed and above-all, highly-readable. This is a screenshot of the Daryl theme as it stands now:
![Daryl screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewcodes/daryl/master/daryl-screenshot.png)

The name of this theme is from [Daryl Dixon](http://walkingdead.wikia.com/wiki/Daryl_Dixon_(TV_Series)), of the Walking Dead. Great character from a stellar television show.

##This theme is:

- Mobile-first and by nature, performant-first
- Responsive by default
- Small file size
- No Sass/Less. Vanilla HTML and CSS.
- Includes an Archive/Post-list page template.

##Installation

* Install the Command Line Developer Tools or Xcode (which includes the Command Line Developer Tools) if you don't already have it installed.
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
More info [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on Jekyll prerequisites.

* Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com):
```bash
gem install jekyll
```

* Install the jekyll-paginate gem:
```bash

```

* Before deploying your site to a produciton enviornment, remove lines 16-27 in the "_includes/head.html" file as this contains my own Google Analytics code.

##Development

Daryl’s *Master* branch is the “clean branch”. *Master* is ready to be deployed at all times once this theme is released. All development will be done on their own branches in a SEMVER style. If a patch or feature needs to be pushed to _Master_, a 1.1.0 (for feature) or 1.0.1 (for a patch/fix) will be created and developed on.

Since this is an open source project, pull requests for fixes are welcome. If you would like to change the design of this theme, please fork this project.
