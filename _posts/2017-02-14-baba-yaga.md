> Iosef: Who? That fucking nobody?
> Vigo: That fucking nobody is John Wick.
>
> Vigo: He once was an associate of ours. They called him Baba Yaga.
> Iosef: The Boogieman?
> Vigo: Well, John wasn't exactly the Boogieman.
>
> Vigo: He was the one you sent to kill the fucking Boogieman.
> Iosef: Oh.
> Vigo: John is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will, something you know very little about. I once saw him kill three men in a bar, with a pencil. With a fuckin' pencil.
>
> Vigo: Then suddenly one day he asked to leave. It's over a woemn, of course. So I made a deal with him. I gave him an inpossible task. A job no one could have pulled off.
>
> Vigo: The bodies he buried that day, laid the foundation of what we are now.
>
> Vigo: And then, my son, a few days after his wife died, you steal his car, and kill his fucking dog.
