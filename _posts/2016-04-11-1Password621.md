1Password for Mac 6.2.1 is now available.

# [6.2.1 (build #621002)](https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPM4#621002)

Ah, spring. The time to sow seeds and shower them with love and care and well, water, so that we may expect a beautiful flowering in the months to come. Spring is also when those pesky weeds start poking their heads out of the soil. The joy of the garden is so much greater when they're all pulled, isn't it?

We sowed a few seeds and pulled a few weeds in your fabulous 1Password 6.2 garden and upgraded it to 6.2.1. You adventurous types will be happy to hear that we've added support for Safari Tech Preview. We also fixed an issue that occasionally caused QuickLook, viewing and exporting to fail when working with attachments. Webloc attachments will no longer cause 1Password to crash, sorry about that. Enjoy!

We love hearing from you! To provide feedback or get in touch with us, please join us in our discussion forums, email support@agilebits.com, send a message to @1Password on Twitter, or leave a comment on Facebook and tell us about the newest tricks you’ve learned
