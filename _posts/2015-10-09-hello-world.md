Hi there, thanks for checking out Daryl, a performant and simple theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I designed this theme to be as readable as possible, to be simple to use, and to keep the code used as vanilla as possible.

It's open source for a reason: I've learned a lot from open source software and I'm trying to give a little something back. Hope you enjoy.
