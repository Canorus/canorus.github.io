## UI Redesigned.

Downie's UI has been redesinged from the ground up to match up with the new trends in UI aesthetics. Similar to the UI of Permute, it features a more streamlined, easy-to-use UI with less clutter.

## Permute integrated.

While limited, Downie has had postprocedssing options for quite some time now, which allows you to convert the resulting file into MP4 or MP3 files. These options are still in place, but those who'd like to have more control over the target format (or would like to get multi-part downloads stitched) can now do so using the Permute integration.

## Per-download options.

Click on the download image preview and get various options for the download - select from different subtitles, qualities, change the post-processing option for that particular download and much more! Note: Some of the options are available only before the download has started.

## Improved progress indicators and drag & drop reordering.

When extracting a playlist, or multiple videos from a single web page, Downie will provide a much better progress indicator. You can now reorder downloads using drag & drop as well.

**And many, many other improvements and fixes...**
