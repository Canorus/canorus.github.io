When I first started shooting videos of penspinning combos [^1], I was told to use this piece of software called [amcap](https://amcap.en.softonic.com). EVERY SINGLE penspinners in Korea use this software, and it didn't cause problem much since Windows is dominant in Korea, especially among teenagers.

[^1]: in fact I started spinning when I was in middle school, that is 2005, but didn't shoot videos until 2012.

Until, I came in.

Since Amcap doesn't work on MacOS[^2], I had to find another way to shoot the video.

[^2]: OSX back then

First try, QuickTime: didn't work. Too choppy, like 10fps.

Second try, Amcap with WineHQ. Amcap needed additional library/dll etc. lacked in macOS, or OSX.

So I had 2 options; a video capturing application that shoots video in 30fps on macOS, or an application that tunes my webcam settings.

I went through possibly every free application I could find on the internet[^3], and some paid applications that were included in bundle sales I purchased in the past[^4], but none of them actually worked.

[^3]: it almost took 2 full years.
[^4]: btw these inlcuded Camtasia Studio and Screen Flow

So I ended up finding application that tunes my webcam settings, and here's what I found.

Set-ups

- Mac mini(2012 late), running macOS sierra 10.12.6
- logitech pro 9000 [buy on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?field-keywords=logitech+pro+9000)
- QuickTime 10.4
- Webcam Settings [buy on Mac App Store, $7.99](https://itunes.apple.com/kr/app/webcam-settings/id533696630?mt=12)

Once you install and run the application, this application give you plenty of options to modify your camera settings. Here's screenshot of setting I use.

This way you can shoot video 30fps on your macOS.

p.s. Another benefit of using this method: you save a lot of space. The size of video rarely exceeds 200MB. With Amcap method, it exceeds 1GB with only 5 minutes of video, and it required additional video conversion process, since it save video in mAVI format.
